This third part of our project has the goal of transforming our dynamic pages into a fully functioning and responsive website. In addition to the main aim of  building  a user-friendly portal that is responsive and adjustable  to various devices, we also  made  it user interactive that can respond to the needs of users with many different functionalities. Instead of displaying static content now it can modify/remove/add and implement other types of tasks.

The button validates whether the order number provided is in the correct format then allows the user to ask  questions about their orders.

* Sign-Up: The sign-up page models the users and asks them for their details in order to create their account.
