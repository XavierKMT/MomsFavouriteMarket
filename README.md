Introduction
------------
This project consists of an online grocery store website. The goal of part two of the assignment is to start implementing dynamic features using javascript and html. The main aim is to build a user-friendly portal that is responsive and adjusts to various devices- laptops, mobile phones and tablets.


Description
-----------

The website consists of the following pages:

	Front-End:
~~
*Main/Home Page:This page gives the users access to all sections of the website, along with a summary of the ongoing promotions and the latest news. It also apprises the user of the history of the website and its approach towards environmental issues. The different sections provide recipes and display the open job positions for prospective candidates.

*Aisle pages: These allow the user to browse through all the products. A page for each aisle has been created and the aisles themselves are initially ordered by relevance. However, the user can also sort the products in alphabetical order (from A to Z or from Z to A). Further, items can be arranged according to their price as well- in ascending or descending order.

*Product Description Pages: These webpages display the products to the customer. Properties such as weight and price are clearly shown in order to assist the user in buying the item of their choice. A link to the cart is also provided so that the desired product can easily be added.

*Cart: This page allows the users to view their products, the total amount and to change the quantity of the specified product. 'Checkout' and 'Continue Shopping' buttons have been provided.

*Log in page: This page gives both the user and the Admin the ability to log onto their accounts. It additionally allows first-time buyers to make their way to the sign-up page via the link provided.

*Sign-Up: The sign-up page models the users and asks them for their details in order to create their account. In addition, the page also familiarizes the user with the privacy policy of the store, informing them about the terms and conditions prior to signing up. The customer is also provided with the option to reset their information, or to log-in (in-case they already have an account) via a link to the aforementioned page.


	
	Back-Store:
~~
*Product List pages: These pages allow the Admin to browse through all the products. They will be able to see the image of the product, its name, its product number, its price and its inventory. In addition, they will also be able to add a new product or edit an existing one. All the products of a particular aisle will be visible to them.

*Edit a Product page: New products can be added and the description of existing ones can be modified by filling in the text boxes provided. The instructions have been laid out in a clear manner in order to enhance the browsing experience.

* User accounts page: This page allows the Admin to see all of the registered users that exist in the system. From this the Admin can either add a user, or edit a pre-existing user profile. Alternatively, the Admin is given the option to delete user profiles.

*Edit User Profile: This page allows the Admin to edit an existing user profile based on the data (of the customer) collected before.

*Order List: The main function here is to give the Admin level users access to all the available orders that have either been completed or will be completed. It gives them the option to click on an order and view its description and be able to edit or adjust it.

*Order 4013.1,2,3 pages : These webpages give the Admin access to modify, add, remove, update and save new changes to the items of a specific order. In addition to that, the Admin can also verify the available quantity of the specific item (whether or not it is in stock).
